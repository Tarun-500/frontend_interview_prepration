  <small>
<strong> Undefined: </strong>   It means a variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. Essentially, it represents the absence of any value. It's like an empty container that hasn't been filled yet.
If you declare a variable x but don't assign any value to it, its value will be undefined.
let  x;  
console.log(x); // output : undefined

<strong>Null: </strong> It's explicitly assigned by a programmer to represent an empty or non-existent value. It's like saying "there is nothing here on purpose."
For example:

If you assign null to a variable y, you're explicitly saying that y has no value.
let  y = null;
console.log(y); // output: null
