## Q1: What is React.js and why do we use it?

<small>React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook in 2011, it was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed and later open-sourced in 2013. React enables developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. It emphasizes a component-based architecture, allowing for reusable UI components, and utilizes a virtual DOM to enhance performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the actual DOM.</small>

## Q2: What are the key features of React.js?

<small>React.js offers several key features that make it a popular choice for building dynamic user interfaces:

- **Declarative Syntax:** React follows a declarative programming paradigm, enabling developers to design views for each state in the application, and React efficiently updates and renders components as data changes. This approach enhances code readability and maintenance. [Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Applications in React are built using encapsulated components that manage their own state. This modularity promotes code reuse and simplifies both development and maintenance. [Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)

- **Virtual DOM:** React utilizes a virtual DOM, an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM updates only that specific object in the real DOM, leading to improved performance and a smoother user experience.

- **JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension):** JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code, making the code more readable and easier to write. [Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)

- **One-way Data Binding:** React uses unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows in a single direction, which makes it easier to understand and debug applications. [Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)

- **Performance:** React enhances performance by using techniques like virtual DOM and efficient diff algorithms to minimize direct DOM manipulations. [Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)

- **Flexibility and Modularity:** React's component-based architecture allows developers to build modular and maintainable code, making it flexible to use in various projects. [Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html)

These features collectively contribute to React's efficiency and popularity in building dynamic and responsive web applications.</small>
