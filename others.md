### What is a Superset?
A superset means a language or system that includes all the features of another language plus additional features. 
you can say that a superset is like a copy of another language with extra features, but it's more than just a copy.

A Superset Means:
✅ It includes all features of the original language (subset).
✅ It adds extra features that improve functionality.
✅ Code from the subset still works inside the superset.
Example - TypeScript, C++, SCSS, and MySQL
