 <small>
    TypeScript is a **programming language developed by Microsoft in 2012**. It is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **static typing** and better error handling. It was created because JavaScript had **no type safety, debugging issues, and was hard to manage in big projects**. TypeScript helps by **catching errors early** and making code more reliable.
