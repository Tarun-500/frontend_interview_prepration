1) Api Method - Put, post, get, patch, delete




2) Put vs Patch :-
PUT: Imagine you have a piece of paper with some information written on it. When you use PUT, you're replacing the entire piece of paper with a new one that has updated information. Everything on the old paper is discarded.

PATCH: With PATCH, you're like a teacher marking corrections on a student's homework. You only change the parts that need updating without redoing the entire homework.



3) Get vs Post - GET is used to retrieve data from a server, while POST is used to send data to a server for processing or storage.
